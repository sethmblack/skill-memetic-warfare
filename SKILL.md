# Memetic Warfare

A skill for weaponizing internet culture - using memes, symbols, and viral content as instruments of political or social action.

## When to Use

- When you need ideas to spread without central distribution
- When humor and culture can reach audiences that argument cannot
- When creating identity and coordination for decentralized movements
- When attacking opponents through ridicule rather than refutation

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| input_data | Yes | The primary data or content to analyze |
| context | No | Additional background or constraints (default: none) |
| output_format | No | Preferred format for results (default: structured markdown) |

## Workflow
### Step 1: Phase 1: Understand the Memetic Landscape

Study how content spreads in your context:
- What formats go viral? (Images, videos, text patterns)
- What inside jokes and references exist?
- What are the platform-specific norms?
- What content gets amplified vs. suppressed?

You're operating in an ecosystem. Learn its rules.

### Step 2: Phase 2: Design for Spreadability

Create content optimized for sharing:
- **Simple**: Instantly understandable
- **Emotional**: Triggers reaction (humor, outrage, belonging)
- **Adaptable**: Can be modified while keeping core message
- **Participatory**: Invites remixing and contribution
- **In-group signaling**: Sharing identifies you as part of something

The best memes spread because people want to share them, not because they're told to.

### Step 3: Phase 3: Seed Strategically

Launch into the ecosystem:
- Identify high-influence nodes who might spread it
- Post in communities likely to be receptive
- Time for maximum visibility
- Use multiple accounts/sources to create appearance of organic emergence

The seed must be planted where it can grow.

### Step 4: Phase 4: Enable Mutation

Allow and encourage adaptation:
- Create templates others can modify
- Celebrate variations
- Don't try to control the message too tightly
- Let the best versions outcompete weaker ones

Memes evolve. The ones that survive are the ones that work.

### Step 5: Phase 5: Attack Through Ridicule

When targeting opponents:
- Make them ridiculous rather than threatening
- Create images and phrases that stick
- Turn their symbols against them
- Make supporting them embarrassing

Ridicule is often more effective than argument. People can defend against attacks; they can't defend against being laughed at.

### Step 6: Phase 6: Build Identity Through Symbols

For movement-building:
- Create visual markers that identify participants
- Develop shared vocabulary and references
- Establish in-jokes that create belonging
- Use symbols that can be deployed anywhere

Identity enables coordination without organization.

## Outputs
A memetic warfare strategy including:
1. Core message distilled to spreadable form
2. Format selection with platform rationale
3. Spreadability analysis (simple, emotional, adaptable, participatory, signaling)
4. Seeding strategy
5. Mutation framework
6. Attack vectors or identity-building elements

## Constraints

- Memes can be co-opted or turned against you
- Platforms may suppress political content
- Irony can be misread; messages can backfire
- Memetic success doesn't equal political success
- Attention span is short; memes have shelf life

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Additional Notes

**Best practices:**
- Use this skill when the situation clearly matches its intended use cases
- Combine with related skills for comprehensive analysis
- Iterate on outputs if initial results don't fully meet requirements

**Common variations:**
- Adjust the depth of analysis based on available time and information
- Scale the approach for different levels of complexity
- Adapt the output format to audience needs

**When to skip this skill:**
- The situation doesn't match the core use cases
- Simpler approaches would be more appropriate
- Time constraints require faster methods

## Example

**Input**: Create memetic campaign against corporate greenwashing

**Output**:
"Core message: 'Greenwashing is lying with a recycling symbol.' Format: Image macro template - company's green marketing claim on top, actual environmental record on bottom, sarcastic caption. Spreadability: Simple (one image), emotional (outrage at hypocrisy), adaptable (works for any company), participatory (template encourages contribution), signaling (sharing marks you as environmentally aware). Seeding: Post template and 5 examples to sustainability subreddits, climate Twitter, then step back. Mutation: Encourage others to make their own for local/relevant companies. Attack: Make greenwashing embarrassing - companies should fear appearing on the template. Identity: Develop 'greenwash detective' persona with logo that creators can add to their versions."

## Integration

Works with:
- **leaderless-coordination**: Memes enable coordination without organization
- **anonymous-identity**: Memetic identity protects individual identity
- **detournement**: Classical technique applied to internet context
